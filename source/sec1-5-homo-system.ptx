                A system  <m>AX = B</m> of linear equations
is called <alert> homogeneous</alert> if 
<m>B = 0</m>. Otherwise it is called a  <alert>  non homogeneous</alert>  system.

<p>
    Observe that any homogeneous system <m>AX = 0</m> of linear
equations has at least one solution, namely the trivial solution (<m>x_i = 0</m>, for all <m>i</m>).  The augmented matrix is
got from adding one zero column to <m>A</m>. Hence <m>.r(A) =
r(A^*)</m>.

<theorem xml:id="thm-hom-system1">
        <statement>
        <p>
            A homogeneous system  <m>AX = 0</m> of <m>n</m> equations
            in the
            same number of unknowns (<m>n</m> unknowns) has a nontrivial
            solution if and only if <m>A</m> is singular, that is , if and
            only if <m>\det(A)=0</m>.

    <proof>
        <p>
            
        The given  homogeneous system has a nontrivial
        solution if and only if it has infinitely many solutions,
        if and only if <m>r(A)\lt n</m>, the number of variables (<xref ref="thm-nosol-rank"/>).
        But <m>r(A)\lt n </m>, if and only if <m>A</m> is singular.

        <statement>
            <p>
                A homogeneous system  <m>AX = 0</m> of <m>m</m> equations
in <m>n</m> unknowns, where <m>m \lt n</m> has infinitely many nontrivial solutions.

</p>
<p>
    <proof>
        If <m>m \lt n</m>, then <m>r(A) \lt  n</m> and hence the result follows from thm.~

    We would
like to get the connection between solutions of a homogeneous system
<m>AX = 0</m> and  the solutions of <m>AX = B</m>, <m>B \neq 0</m>. These
are stated in the following Theorem.

</p>
<p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-hom-system3">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Suppose the non homogeneous system <m>AX
                = B</m> of linear equations has a solution say <m>X = X_0</m>.
                All the solutions of this system are of the form
                <me>X_0 + X_h,</me>
                where <m>X_h</m> runs through all the solutions of the
                corresponding homogeneous system <m>AX =0</m>. 
            </p>
        </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
        <proof>
            <p>
                Let <m>X_h</m> be a solution of <m>AX=0</m>. Then 
                <me>A(X_0 + X_h) = AX_0 + A
                    X_h = B + 0 = B</me>. Hence <m>X_0 +X_h</m> is a solution of <m>AX =
                    B</m>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                    Suppose <m>Y</m> is a solution of <m>AX = B</m>, i.e. <m>AY = B</m>.
                    Then <m>A (Y - X_0) = 0</m> and hence <m>Y-X_0</m> is a solution of
                    <m>AX = 0</m> and <m>Y = X_0+(Y-X_0)=X_0+X_h</m>, where <m>X_h=Y-X_0</m>.

    <p> The above theorem can be written equivalently as

        <theorem xml:id="thm-hom-system4">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    
            If <m>(\alpha_1 ,\ldots, \alpha_n)</m> is a solution of a system of linear equations, then
            the complete solution is given by <m>x_1 = \alpha_1 + y_1 ,\ldots , x_n = \alpha_n + y_n</m> , where
            <m>(y_1 ,\ldots, y_n)</m> is the general solution of the associated homogeneous system.
