  <p> 
    The solution of a system of linear equations is unchanged if the following operations are performed. If, fact this is the basis for solving a system of linear equations.
  </p>
<ol>
    <li> Multiply one of the equations by a nonzero real number.
      This is equivalent to multiplying one of the rows of the
      augmented matrix of the system by a non-zero real number.
    </li>
    <li> Multiply one of the equations by a real number and add
      the result to another equation, leaving the original equation
      unchanged.
      
      This is equivalent to multiplying one of the rows of the
      augmented matrix of the system by a real number and adding it
      to another row, leaving the original row unchanged.
    </li>
      <li>  Interchanging two equations.
      
      This is equivalent to interchanging two rows of the augmented
      matrix of the system.
    </li>
      <li>  Bring the equations which are equivalent to <m>0 =0</m> to
      the bottom row.
      
      This is equivalent to moving the zero rows (rows with zero
      entries) of the augmented matrix to the bottom.
      </li>
    </ol>  
   <note>
    If an equation of the system after the elementary after reduces to <m> 0 = k</m>,
    where <m>k \neq 0</m>, then the system has no solution.
    This is equivalent to if a row of the augmented matrix is
    composed of zeros except for the last number, then the system
    has no solution.

  Row operations on a matrix can be obtained by matrix multiplication. Before we see this, let us look at the following observations.
